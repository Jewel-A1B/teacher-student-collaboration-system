ðŸŽ“ **Simple Teacher-Student Management System | Our First Java Team Project**

As programming beginners, my team and I built this desktop application to practice Java together!

**What we used to learn:**
â€¢ AI assistance, YouTube tutorials, Google documentation for Java Swing basics, syntax, debugging errors and design
â€¢ Team collaboration and peer learning

**What we managed to build:**
âœ… Basic login system for students & teachers
âœ… Simple registration form
âœ… Course dashboard and creation features
âœ… Review/rating system
âœ… File-based data storage

**Biggest challenges:**
â€¢ Understanding Swing layouts (took days!)
â€¢ File handling confusion
â€¢ Getting button events to work
â€¢ Adding data validation

**Key learnings:**

- Problem-solving through breaking down complex issues as a team
- How to effectively use learning resources together
- Patience is crucial for debugging (and helping teammates!)
- Basic OOP concepts in real practice
- Importance of teamwork in software development

This project taught us that programming is all about persistence, continuous learning, and collaboration. Every error message was a new lesson for the whole team!

**Future goals:** Learn databases, improve UI design, study design patterns
